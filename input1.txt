#four tasks with long durations and no domain constraints, but binary constraints that force them to run on different days

task, weld_chassis 8
task, tweak_axle 7
task, vulcanise_rubber 8
task, test_bulletproof_tyres 8

#binary constraints
constraint, weld_chassis before tweak_axle
constraint, test_bulletproof_tyres after vulcanise_rubber
constraint, tweak_axle before vulcanise_rubber

#soft constraints
domain, test_bulletproof_tyres ends-by thu 4pm 300
